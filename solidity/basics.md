### **ðŸ‘‹ Solidity **

Highly influenced by C++, Python, Javascript  and focuses on EVM (Ethereum virtual Machine)

Ethereum is a decentralized ie. blockchain platform that runs smart contracts

EVM converts Smart contracts into Bytecode. It is runtime environment for Ethereum. 

Smart contracts just provide credible transactions without third parties interferece. 

```
pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.6.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
   uint storedData;

   function set(uint x) public {
      storedData = x;
   }

   function get() public view returns (uint) {
      return storedData;
   }
}
```

A **Solidity contract** is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereumblockchain.


**Address** holds the 20 byte value representing the size of an Ethereum address. Address is a datatype in solidity. 


Use remix.ethereum as IDE to create Smart contracts in Ethereum. 

The smart contract will be like a microservice all read write data with it, execute it. Its publically accessible. 



**Pointers**
1. ```uint``` cannot be negative 
2. View functions ensure that they will not modify the state. 
3. Getter method are by default view functions


3 Types of variables in Solidity: 

**State Variables** Variables whose values are permanently stored in a Contract storage.

**Local Variables** Variables whose values are present till function is executing.

**Global Variables** These are special variables which exist in global namespace and are used to get information about the blockchain. 

**Solidity-Structs**

Struct types are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book âˆ’

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract test {
   struct Book { 
      string title;
      string author;
      uint book_id;
   }
   Book book;

   function setBook() public {
      book = Book('Learn Java', 'TP', 1);
   }
   function getBookId() public view returns (uint) {
      return book.book_id;
   }
}
```

**mapping** is like **associative array** or like hash map in other languages

```mapping(unit=>Person) public people;``` is like hashmap. 

In Solidity, no way to figure out size of array, so we have to keep track of it with count inside structs. 


**Modifiers**

**public modifier**: can be used by external callers. 

**internal functions**: external callers cant use them. 

**Custom modifiers**: we can create our own modifiers. 

```
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner); 
}
```
*require has to be true otherwise error thrown*

**msg.sender** is very important. 

Use Epoch time in ethereum as well. 

```block.timestamp``` is used to find ```now()```
